Hi, I'm James.

I'm passionate about travelling, learning, and taking on "fun challenges".

On this blog, you can read about my latest learnings and ramblings as I progress through ever more fun challenges.

If you want a quick catch up on who I am, skip straight to [my One Second Everyday]({{< ref "tags/one-second-everyday" >}}).

Professionally, I am a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net) in London building the foundations for the next generation of scalable, dependable Banks.

This year, 2024, my goal is to improve at writing, with a focus on documenting my experiences and learnings in the hope that others may learn along the way.

Feel free to reach out to me using the links above regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
