Hi, I'm James.

I'm passionate about learning, building 'cool' stuff and travelling.
If you want a quick catch up on who I am, skip straight to [my One Second Everyday]({{< ref "tags/one-second-everyday" >}}).

At the moment, I can generally be found in and around [London, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), or online by clicking on any of the links above.

In my spare time you'll probably find me hopping on a cheap plane somewhere, camera in my hand and in search for an adventure.

Feel free to reach out to me using the links above regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
