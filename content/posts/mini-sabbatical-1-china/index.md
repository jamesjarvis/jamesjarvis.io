## Landing in Shanghai

![Leaving from Singapore](./leaving_singapore.jpeg "Looking like a proper tourist, I leave my hotel in Singapore for the last time")

My flight is at 8:05 AM from Changi.

A week ago I had bought a backpack just for this trip, 2 days ago I started packing, yesterday I dropped off the rest of my stuff with a coworker to pick up on the way back.

I'm ready.
Despite the comforts offered to me in Singapore, I feel well prepared for the next 6 weeks living out of this bag.
I have sampled the food, hung out with the locals, I feel like I know what to expect from China, and yet it still occasionally feels mysterious.

My girlfriend, Feiyang (çŽ‹é£žæ‰¬), has been travelling from London since the day before, due to arrive in Shanghai Pudong International Airport just after I leave from Singapore, so we've planned to meet up at the hotel while she spends the morning with an old school friend.

I board, so eager to land I forget whatever I was reading on the flight.

On arrival, I'm immediately reminded that China is not-quite-Singapore, not-quite-Thailand.

### Scammed by a taxi

Stepping out of the international arrivals section, a guy comes up to me in a suit, claiming he works for the airport (with an official looking pin on his blazer to qualify himself).

"Do you need a taxi?"

I still believe taxi's are "basically free", from my experience so far around South East Asia and, besides, none of my translation/navigation apps work and I can't read Mandarin well enough to communicate with anyone.
So I say yes.

We proceed to walk towards, and then straight past, the Taxi pickup zone, and towards the car park.
"Uh, taxi's are here?" I point to the queue of at least 15 official taxis, with a matching orderly queue of prospective passengers.

Never mind that, we continue into the car park, where a very fancy looking [xpeng](https://www.xpeng.com) electric car is awaiting me.

"How much?" I ask, expecting roughly Â£15 worth for the 40 minute drive.

"550".
This is in Yuan, so my basic maths of converting to GBP already tells me I'm getting ripped off.

Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea how much things cost in this part of the world, my first impressions are that this place costs roughly the same as New York.

"I only have 300" I reply, opening my wallet to prove what little Thai Baht or Indonesian Rupiah I had exchanged on departure had afforded me about half a taxi's worth of currency.

No worries though, the man happily shoves his hand into my wallet, takes the cash (all of the cash I had) and waves me into the Taxi.

Welcome to China!

In the taxi, I test out my esim + Wechat account, thankfully it works.
Feiyang helpfully informs me I've been ripped off, and that I should have got one of the official taxis, obviously.

### The Bund, choking on intestines

We meet at the hotel, but head straight for the Bund to see the sights, and have dinner with her friend.

![Meeting at the Bund in Shanghai](./shanghai_bund.jpeg "First time seeing each other for 3 months")

The place is so crowded!
Every restaurant appears to require a booking (not sure why I'm surprised, London is the same), and the sea of people in and around the Bund is only broken by the occasional Chinese military sentry guard, standing like a statue on a plinth.

At the hotpot, amongst many kinds of meat and veg, we ate some duck intestine.
Normally this would be fine, but my recent decision to get braces meant that I could no longer chew very well.

So I swallowed it whole, or at least most of it.
The end bit got caught on a piece of my braces, leading me to perform the final act of a sword swallower and pull out the entire 30cm strand of intestine from my throat, with the accompanying gagging.

![Shanghai's high street](./shanghai_street.jpeg "On this street is a Huawei shop directly opposite Apple, selling totally-not-copied wares")

Great first impression with China, and Feiyang's friend.
We went back to the hotel shortly afterwards, tired from the days events!

### China or Europe?

Day 2 we started with a coffee and croissant from the very European feeling old streets.

![Shanghai old streets](./shanghai_old_street.jpeg "Shanghai or Europe?")

Shanghai in general felt very westernised.
It was clear that it was somehow different to the rest of China, but we couldn't quite put our finger on it.
The Bund was famously owned by various European trading companies, and it's banks are lined with European inspired architecture, but aside from this there was also a slightly different feeling to the people there.
It might have something to do with the fact that Feiyang was asked twice if she was a model, so that made us feel quite cool.

Checking out the Chenghuang temple area, we stopped for some lunch.

![Chenghuang](./shanghai_chenghuang_temple.jpeg)

This was a peculiar mix of very ancient religious temple, with a disney-esque commercial building, with tourist shops, buddhist temples and gold jewellery shops side by side.

![Chenghuang bridge](./shanghai_chenghuang_temple_bridge.jpeg "Pretty bridge with a tea house in the middle")

Continuing with the European strangeness, I had my first experience with the Chinese nouveau riche as we had dinner in Xintiandi.
For those who don't know, it's basically like the Covent Garden / Mayfair of London, complete with Lululemon, On Running and DJI shops (to summarise our personalities).

Not something I expected in such a recently wealthy country, but then again totally understandable.
This would continue to be a theme with all big cities we visited throughout China.
Luxury is IN.

### Oriental Pearl

Of course, no trip to Shanghai would be complete without the obligatory trip to the [Oriental Pearl TV Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Pearl_Tower).

![Oriental Pearl Tower](./shanghai_oriental_pearl.jpeg)

Built in 1995, the city has extended skywards around it.
Whilst it used to be a TV broadcast tower (back when TV was delivered by these large broadcasting antennae), it is now purely a tourist attraction, with a rotating restaurant, and weirdly misplaced arcade inside the red balls.

I didn't realise this, but it is also designed to look very similar to a sort of sugary caramel street snack (balls on a stick).
I think I prefer the look of the building to the taste of this snack though.

You can get some great views though!
Both looking out, and looking down...

![Looking down from Oriental Pearl](./shanghai_oriental_pearl_looking_down.jpeg "Why can't all skyscrapers have glass floors?")

Day 4, have you settled in yet?
Good.
Let's go to the Capital.

## Meeting the GF's Family

![Meeting the Family](./beijing_meeting_family.jpeg "We didn't mean to stand in height order")

"Isn't he cold?"

I had packed for a 6 week long beach trip, without first checking the weather in Beijing.

It's 14 degrees and I look like a complete mug in my shorts and birkenstocks.

The language barrier is quite the challenge, but we seem to get along just fine as they drive us from the train station and around the city (past Tiananmen square and the Mao photo).
We stopped for a hearty meal then back to the parent's district where Feiyang and I checked into a hotel opposite their flat.
Still easing in gently.

![Beijing suburbs](./beijing_suburbs.jpeg "Awoke to the sound of military training")

In the morning, we are accompanied to views of the sprawling suburbs of Beijing.
The expansiveness of Beijing drew parallels with Los Angeles in my mind.
The benefit to Beijing is that even though the easiest way to travel is by car, it at least has a functioning metro system.

We are roughly 9 miles from central Beijing.
A mere 20 years ago this would have been right in the boonies, as evident by the remnants of farms and military training grounds nearby (we actually awoke to the sounds of horns and distant marching beats!)

Nowadays however, this is prime commuter belt territory, and we took advantage of the tube system every day to get around.
Weirdly, I had to scan my passport to enter the tube, why?
Well,
