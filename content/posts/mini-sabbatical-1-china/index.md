## Landing in Shanghai

My flight is at 8:05 AM from Changi.
A week ago I had bought a backpack just for this trip, 2 days ago I started packing, yesterday I dropped off the rest of my stuff with a coworker to pick up on the way back.

I'm ready.
Despite the comforts offered to me in Singapore, I feel well prepared for the next 6 weeks living out of this bag.
I have sampled the food, hung out with the locals, I feel like I know what to expect from China, and yet it still occasionally feels mysterious.

My girlfriend, Feiyang (çŽ‹é£žæ‰¬), has been travelling from London since the day before, due to arrive in Shanghai Pudong International Airport just after I leave from Singapore, so we've planned to meet up at the hotel while she spends the morning with an old school friend.

I board, so eager to land I forget whatever I was reading on the flight.

On arrival, I'm immediately reminded that China is not-quite-Singapore, not-quite-Thailand.

Stepping out of the international arrivals section, a guy comes up to me in a suit, claiming he works for the airport (with an official looking pin on his blazer to qualify himself).

"Do you need a taxi?"

I still believe taxi's are "basically free", from my experience so far around South East Asia and, besides, none of my translation/navigation apps work and I can't read Mandarin well enough to communicate with anyone.
So I say yes.

We proceed to walk towards, and then straight past, the Taxi pickup zone, and towards the car park.
"Uh, taxi's are here?" I point to the queue of at least 15 official taxis, with a matching orderly queue of prospective passengers.

Never mind that, we continue into the car park, where a very fancy looking [xpeng](https://www.xpeng.com) electric car is awaiting me.

"How much?" I ask, expecting roughly Â£15 worth for the 40 minute drive.

"550".
This is in Yuan, so my basic maths of converting to GBP already tells me I'm getting ripped off.

Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea how much things cost in this part of the world, my first impressions are that this place costs roughly the same as New York.

"I only have 300" I reply, opening my wallet to prove what little Thai Baht or Indonesian Rupiah I had exchanged on departure had afforded me about half a taxi's worth of currency.

No worries though, the man happily shoves his hand into my wallet, takes the cash (all of the cash I had) and waves me into the Taxi.

Welcome to China!

In the taxi, I test out my esim + Wechat account, thankfully it works.
Feiyang helpfully informs me I've been ripped off, and that I should have got one of the official taxis, obviously.

We meet at the hotel, but head straight for the Bund to see the sights, and have dinner with her friend.

The place is so crowded!
Every restaurant appears to require a booking (not sure why I'm surprised, London is the same), and the sea of people in and around the Bund is only broken by the occasional Chinese military sentry guard, standing like a statue on a plinth.
