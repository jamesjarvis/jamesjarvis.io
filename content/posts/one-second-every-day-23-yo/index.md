From 23rd June 2021 to 23rd June 2022.

As the world slowly started to shake off the pandemic I decided to move to London with Konrad. Then I immediately got COVID *facepalm*.

Living in my favourite city in the world for a whole year has been a lot of fun (and v expensive), making some new friends and getting used to a bit more of a settled down lifestyle, although it is a bit scary!

I've continued with my hobby of making and breaking lots of software, sailed on the Thames, hiked Snowdonia, and met Feiyang!

My love-hate relationship with the BMW has continued, from having to almost scrap it in November to driving it 3000 miles around Europe in June; I finally drove to the Italian lakes!
