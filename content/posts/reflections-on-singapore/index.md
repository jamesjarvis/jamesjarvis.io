This is a 3 part series of posts:

- [Setting up for a Mini-Sabbatical]({{<ref "/posts/mini-sabbatical-setup">}})
- [Reflections on 3 months living and working in Singapore]({{<ref "." >}}) (you are here!)
- Reflections on 6 weeks of travel around South East Asia (üöß Under Construction)

## Arrival

I landed in Singapore on Monday, 1st August.
I was supposed to originally fly out a week prior, but delayed it due to having already booked tickets with my Dad to see our first ever Formula E (it‚Äôs a strange sport, we were sat inside! The races don't last particularly long, but give it a few more years and I could see it taking on Formula 1!)

Heathrow was‚Ä¶ Heathrow-ish?
I checked in a bit early and had a few hours to kill, which I duly spent eating a microwaved fish and chips in the overcrowded Wetherspoons at Terminal 5.
Anyway, premium economy was nice - I never realised you could have metal cutlery and wine on a plane!

For those who haven‚Äôt yet experienced it, let me tell you, Singapore Changi airport is in a league of its own!
It‚Äôs a masterpiece of architecture and dignified travel, and almost unimaginable to the average european flier.

Not that I got to see much of it, as my work-booked taxi driver whisked me away immediately on arrival, a mere 20 or so minutes after landing the plane!
I almost fail to appreciate this comfortable efficiency, that will come to become thematic of my overall experience of this new country.
I ask my driver how he finds Singapore.
He says he loved his 30 years in residence, besides some feedback for the weather, and recommends a few touristy activities for me to try out once I settle in.
We cross the nation in 25 minutes.

My base for the next 90 days is Raffles place, the original British landing site and previous colonial centre point of South East Asia.
I find it fitting for my first foray into this part of the world.

After checking in and generally gawking at my new hotel, I enthusiastically change into a pair of shorts, text a coworker-friend and head out for a few drinks to meet the rest of the crew I‚Äôll be working with.

## The Weather

I had been warned ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be sweating after 5 minutes outside, and frozen after 5 minutes inside‚Äù, so I had packed a mix of shorts, trousers and hoodies.
As it turns out, I was quite comfortable with both, as long as I didn‚Äôt move too much outside, or sit too still inside.

On my second weekend I attempted the [MacRitchie Reservoir](https://beta.nparks.gov.sg/visit/parks/central-catchment-nature-reserve/activities/hiking-nature-walk) hike - a 10km hike around one of the few naturally forested areas left in the centre of the island.
I highly recommend giving this a go if you visit, as you‚Äôll be tripping over cicadas, frogs, monkeys, turtles, strangling figs and a whole host of other interesting flora and fauna.
However, do go with a lot of water, sun cream, bug spray and very breathable clothing!
My first na√Øve hike was performed in a cotton shirt and shorts and, by the end of it, I might as well had swam through the reservoir instead.

A quick trip to Uniqlo fixed that, and I was lightly draped with breathable, practically disposable clothes for the remainder of my time there.
If you are coming from a Northern European country, I‚Äôd probably recommend bringing 2 days worth of clothes with you, and just buy whatever you need once you arrive.

A few weeks into my stay, I thought I‚Äôd try and take up running again.
I figured the consistent 7am-7pm sunlight hours worked well with my optimistic morning jog + dip-in-the-pool-to-cool-off routine.
The challenge (besides my pathetic fitness level) is to run as far as you can before the sun really starts to shine and you become too dehydrated to walk straight.
Realistically I only did this just under 20 times, but I loved it, and made some noticeable health improvements whilst out there.

## The government

I'm a sucker for a good museum.
I also love a well planned urban environment.

As a consequence, it turns out I _really_ loved the [Singapore City Gallery](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Singapore-City-Gallery)!
I spent **hours** reading every little plaque about various iterative designs for how to use the reclaimed land on the south side of the island.
Where waste goes, how they ensure energy and water security, to how they plan for the fittingly named [Urban Heat Island Effect](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/urban-heat-island/), I am just continuously in awe at it all.

I've always liked the idea of re-attempting a stint at Architecture (I originally went to visit my old university for an architecture open-day, before giving up and enrolling in computer science for the good old fashioned employment prospects).
So for anyone interested in a similar thing - I recommend this museum.

While we are at it, I won't go into too much detail, but if you're even remotely interested in Architecture or just museums in general, I'd highly recommend:

- [Cloud Forest / Flower Dome](https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/things-to-do/attractions/cloud-forest.html)
  - Worlds tallest indoor waterfall. This was my very first stop, and I ended up going back here 3 more times just for the sheer beauty of it.
- [Garden Rhapsody](https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/things-to-do/calendar-of-events/garden-rhapsody.html)
  - A **free light show**, **every day**! Such a nice atmosphere, you lay on the warm ground and look up at the lights.
- [The Jewel Changi](https://www.jewelchangiairport.com/en/attractions/forest-valley.html)
  - The waterfall is the big attraction, but just look at all those Orchids! The butterfly park and the walking net are the cherry on top.
- [Marina Bay Sands](https://www.marinabaysands.com/attractions/sands-skypark.html)
  - The building synonymous with Singapore goes without saying, but did you know you can also go for morning yoga for only 5 SGD more?
- [Henderson Waves / Cable Car](https://www.mountfaberleisure.com)
  - One is a bridge, one is a cable car. Neither are museums, but both are very pretty!
- [The Supreme Court](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/discover-the-courts)
  - I don't think you can visit - but it looks like a UFO landed on a building...
- [Atlas Bar](https://atlasbar.sg)
  - BEAutiful art-deco style bar. Just don't try and enter in shorts and birkenstocks like I did. They don't like it.
- [Raffles Hotel](https://www.raffles.com/singapore/)
  - It sits on 1 Beach Road and is absolutely iconic of colonial Singapore. Just remember to go to the **writers bar** and not the **long bar**.
- [Chijmes](https://chijmes.com.sg)
  - Strange one, it's a food court around an old church. Similar ish to [Mercato Mayfair](https://mercatometropolitano.com/mercato-mayfair/) in London.
- The list could go on, but I'm getting nostalgic now.

The point here is, you don't get this kind of stuff without a good amount of support from the people running the country.

Whilst "From third world to first" is still on my reading TODO list, I left with much more confidence in the competence of the government than I've ever got from living in the UK or the US.
