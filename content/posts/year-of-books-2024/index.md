summary: "2024 I read a bit less"

Building on my last year getting properly back into reading, this is a continuation of my reflections.
For each book I read, I try and write a short (often poorly worded) review as a way of remembering what I learnt from each book.

In my last post on this topic [here]({{<ref "/posts/year-of-books">}}), I reflected on my 2024 New Years resolution:

> For 2024, one of my primary goals is to write more, and to write more publicly (fail fast, thanks [Levels](https://x.com/levelsio)).

Now I didn't do _too badly_, writing 12 posts to this blog, but I'd like to see that go up in the next year, so consider this the continuation of that goal.

The following has been extracted from a [short script]({{<ref "#appendix">}}) I co-authored with the help of ChatGPT, to export all of my reviews made in 2024.
