Monzo [(here)](monzo.com) is a digital "challenger" bank from the UK.

I thought it would be interesting to use GitHub to automatically update and store data regarding the growth of Monzo's current account user numbers. You can visit the page [here](https://jamesjarvis.github.io/monzo-users/).

Since their website includes an auto updating tally of users, I just found the api and the python scripts utilise this.

Similar to the [COVID-19 infection predictions]({{<ref "posts/predictions">}}), this uses GitHub actions to automatically update and store data regarding the growth of Monzo's current account user numbers.
It also builds a [simple react webpage](https://jamesjarvis.github.io/monzo-users) to display the data in a graph.
Or, if you prefer you can download [the data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesjarvis/monzo-users/master/monzo_users.csv) for yourself.

Feel free to make a PR if you have some data that can fill in the gaps.
