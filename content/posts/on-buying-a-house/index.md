I have a bit of a confession to make.

I am horribly, frustratingly, embarrassingly... _indecisive_.

Anybody who knows me, is aware that for me to purchase something, I generally have to explore every possible opportunity, weighing up imaginary pros and cons in my own head for potentially _months_ before committing to exchanging my hard earned cash for the item.

Unfortunately, I've always been like this.

- It took me 4 months to decide on a new bike earlier this year, when I desperately needed one to commute.
- It took me 3 months the year before that to decide on a new coat for the winter, when I had no waterproofs at all.
- It took me over a month to decide on a replacement car when mine was crashed in to, and I was out of my most useful mode of transport.

But these were comparatively _small_ purchases, all under ¬£10k.
What if I were to continue acting the same, but apply this to the **largest financial decision of my entire life**?

So, we arrive at March 2024.
The beginning of my search.
It'll take a while...

## Why buy?

For context, I have been living primarily in East London (Wapping/Limehouse) for the last 4 years, in flats of varying quality.

The rent was roughly ~2kGBP/month, split between myself and my housemates - not all too bad considering I could cycle into work/around London, and that is something I thoroughly enjoyed doing.

But there was always the sense of impermanence to the rental situation.
Like my housemates, I had never decorated my room, too afraid to knock anything into the walls, or risk losing our deposit.
I "made do" with furniture/appliances/colours/bathrooms I didn't like, because I couldn't get rid of the existing stuff, and I wasn't allowed to change something that wasn't mine.

Cynically, I was starting to assume that landlords fill flats with the cheapest ikea furniture, not because it was cheap for them, but because it would eventually break, and clawing back deposits was another stream of income for them.

Honestly, I was exhausted of not feeling safe enough to make my place of residence, my home.

Settled: I'll buy my own place! (After years of aggressively saving for a deposit).

## What buy?

This one was easy.
Flats are fun, as long as:

- They are located conveniently for transport
- The floor plan is already well laid out, as this is pretty much fixed forever
- The service charge and ground rent is low
- Don't get me started on leasehold, but if this is the only blocker, at least make sure the lease is long

For the longest time, flats were either for people who couldn't afford a house, or in places where the density of housing has to be high.
