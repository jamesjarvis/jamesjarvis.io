From 23rd June 2019 to 23rd June 2020.

Waved goodbye to Cali, met the fam in Florida. Quick catch ups with the friends and family I havenâ€™t seen for a year then straight into the final part of my degree.
Joined Kayaking this time, got to know some lovely people and even travel to Wales with them! Kept working part time with my Cisco team throughout uni, and tinkering in my free time. Took mum to Morocco, met some friends in Barcelona, and had a weekend in Amsterdam with Maj and Sam just a few days before the Coronavirus lockdown!

Lockdown meant I had to slow down a bit, enjoy time with the family and celebrate mine and my sister's birthday at home for the first time in 4 years.
