From the 23rd June 2024 to 23rd June 2025.

I’m already in China when I kick this year off, finishing off another grand tour of new cities with Feiyang and her parents.

Heading back into another brilliant British summer I have a few small holidays and then it’s time for Penny and Owen’s wedding!
A beautiful day and I have never been happier for my little sis.

This year I decided my goal would be to buy a property, as I was tired of not getting value for money from London landlords.
I viewed dozens of places as I pondered between a central flat or suburby house, doer upper or turn key.

In August my grandads health took a severe turn for the worse, and he unfortunately passed away, surrounded by his loved ones.
With all my grandparents now gone I’m saddened to lose another cockney voice from the streets.

The first of my school friends got married!
I travelled up with the same lads I did DofE with almost a decade ago, but budgets and time keep us apart now.
Weeks later one of my best mates moves to Australia in search of a better life.

I finally move in to my first house! Kicking off months of constant daily improvements, as my wonderful family and friends all chip in to help the DIY renovation efforts.
Over the Christmas break Feiyang heads back to China while I replace all the radiators and floors in the house, closely followed by a whole kitchen.

My hardworking aunty finally retires, whilst I have a little think and decide its time for me to change jobs.
Feiyang and I take a few weeks out to travel South Korea and a bit more of China. I've joined the local tennis club, but you wouldn't have known if you saw me play!
