## Back in Beijing

Gubei was awesome, but the unrelenting march of time moves on, and so we find ourselves on the way back to Beijing.

Along we way we stopped for a quick break to relieve ourselves at a rest stop.
Most countries have these places, and they all seem to stand out for different reasons.

For the French, it's the nice public toilets and picnic benches.

For the British, it's the fact that Welcome Break somehow have a monopoly.

For the Americans, it's the strange business-park layout that forces you to drive between buildings.

For the Chinese, [it's the urinals that measure your glucose levels](https://www.odditycentral.com/news/shopping-mall-high-tech-urinals-provide-urine-tests-for-a-fee.html).

Bit surreal, but we continued regardless (I didn't pay to have it done).

### Olympic Park

We still had a couple of hours of sunlight to kill on the way back to the flat, so we thought it would be a good chance to see the buildings that put Beijing on the map for me.
The Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Park!

The Beijing Olympic park is not too dissimilar from Olympic parks from other cities to be honest.
There is the centrepiece stadium, now used by local sports teams or for concerts.
There is of course a _huge_ shopping mall (in this case, under the whole complex) and a few museums to take advantage of the mass transit systems that had to be built.

A few architectural standouts won't go amiss either, such as the [Beijing Olympic Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Olympic_Tower) (that strangely was only build 6 years after the games).
Whilst we didn't go up it, the views would I'm sure have been incredible.

The last place we visited here was the [Olympic Forest Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Forest_Park).
For a city so vast and so heavily developed, it is always welcome to escape into nature a bit, and this park absolutely scratches that itch for so many of Beijing's residents.
Even offering bike + kayak rental for a small fee, it's a quite literal breath of fresh air.

Even though it's pretty far out (right on the edge of the city, a couple hours to get to for us!), it was **absolutely rammed**.
I could liken it maybe to Hyde Park in peak summer, but with almost zero tourists (as Beijing [didn't really have many outside visitors](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136687/china-number-of-arrivals-of-inbound-international-tourists-in-beijing/#:~:text=Arrivals%20of%20overseas%20tourists%20in%20Beijing%202013%2D2023&text=In%202023%2C%20around%201.17%20million,from%20inbound%20tourism%20that%20year.) when I arrived).

The running track that goes through the park was quite comical, with people practically queuing to get past one another, but I digress - clearly it has a strong demand and we must be grateful for it's existence.

We enjoyed sunset with a short hike, then slowly made our way back to the flat.

### Tian Tan Park

More parks!

In the morning, we grabbed ourselves a Chinese pancake and McDonalds coffee (don't judge me) from near Feiyang's flat, and set out to tick some more items off the Tripadvisor list.

Tian Tan (also called the Temple of Heaven) is one of the largest parks in Beijing, or at least the largest one [located centrally](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=39.8822&mlon=116.4066&zoom=15#map=14/39.8884/116.3924).
Within it, you'll fine a well landscaped park, complete with many areas for the traditional "Auntie Dance Class".

This was probably my favourite thing that I saw throughout Asia that I really wish the West had more of.
If you are retired, you need to keep fit _somehow_, so why not join a group and dance to some wildly out of genre tiktok pop songs in a group?
I loved it!

There were some Uncles joining in, but typically they would join the Uncle Class, who would be trying out some other activities such as Tai Chi.

We spotted one absolute legend of an Uncle travelling around on his new toy, a motorised suitcase.

Not quite sure what he was trying to do here, as the suitcase was walking pace, and the cobblestone actually forced him to fall over a couple times, but it was funny to see so I grant him that.

In the center of the Temple of Heaven is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, and the highest concentration of school field trips.
