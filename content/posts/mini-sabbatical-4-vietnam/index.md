Audience: Travel blog with personal details? Or just a factual trip?
I think travel blog with personal takes, but with factual information. Cut out irrelevant information.


- Arriving in Hanoi, immediately rushed into a delivery car to ha long, arriving at midnight
- In the morning, day trip around ha long bay, back to hanoi old quarter arriving at midnight again
- Hostelworld app great way to find out what to do, booked onto walking tour in the morning where I met some cool travellers. Explored the city, something else? Then off to pub street in the evening. Banh Mi 47?
- Day after checking out something else(?) then relax around the lake with aunties dancing, got on bike taxi where I got scammed by the Mafia. Met Harry
- Overnight train to Da Nang, had a monk in my carriage, spent almost all of the time reading and journalling.
- Arrived in Da Nang, strangely empty place so got in a Grab taxi to Hoi An, met the wonderful hostel host (who was angry at me for not telling her I wanted to join the food tour with a friend in Tow) Harry wondered why every time he saw me someone was shouting at me. Had some food at the food tour then went to tailors to get a suit fitted!
- Day in Hoi An, hopping around on our bikes to Cafe, Tailor, Shop, Tailor, Bar, Tailor. Great time. In the evening we went out with the other people we had met from the hostel. Harry regretted booking his hotel in the morning.
- Leaving Hoi An, sent my suit off for shipping back to london. We had a 2pm train to catch from Da Nang so we went straight there I think?
- Another overnight train to Saigon/Ho Chi Minh, where I met a nice Scottish couple enjoying their retirement together. I want to be these people when I'm older (reminded me of Tony and Elain from Race Across the World)
- Day in Saigon, we explored the Cu Chi Tunnels (with a guy that would not stop singing) and War Museum (made me cry).
- Day after, I had a morning bus to take, so said fairwell to Harry. My bus took me to Phnom Penh. I was sat next to a nice lady from Scotland who has chosen to structure her life around travel. Gardening in the UK Summer months, and exploring the rest of the year. She was in her 50s. Arriving in Phnom Penh I took a tuk tuk around town, checking into my hotel, then getting some Udon nearby. Currency is officially cambodian, but prices of everything are in dollars and the owners get out an old calculator to convert. I overhear some westerners talking about an impeding stock market crash?
- Bus to Siem Reap, on arrival I went for a walk to explore the local area, where apparently the thing to do is to have fish clean your feet.
- Whole day in Siem Reap, I hired a bike and cycled around the temples for 8 hours, my favourite part of the trip.
