Audience: Travel blog with personal details? Or just a factual trip?
I think travel blog with personal takes, but with factual information. Cut out irrelevant information.

- Arriving in Hanoi, immediately rushed into a delivery car to ha long, arriving at midnight
- In the morning, day trip around ha long bay, back to hanoi old quarter arriving at midnight again
- Hostelworld app great way to find out what to do, booked onto walking tour in the morning where I met some cool travellers. Explored the city, something else? Then off to pub street in the evening. Banh Mi 47?
- Day after checking out something else(?) then relax around the lake with aunties dancing, got on bike taxi where I got scammed by the Mafia. Met Harry
- Overnight train to Da Nang, had a monk in my carriage, spent almost all of the time reading and journalling.
- Arrived in Da Nang, strangely empty place so got in a Grab taxi to Hoi An, met the wonderful hostel host (who was angry at me for not telling her I wanted to join the food tour with a friend in Tow) Harry wondered why every time he saw me someone was shouting at me. Had some food at the food tour then went to tailors to get a suit fitted!
- Day in Hoi An, hopping around on our bikes to Cafe, Tailor, Shop, Tailor, Bar, Tailor. Great time. In the evening we went out with the other people we had met from the hostel. Harry regretted booking his hotel in the morning.
- Leaving Hoi An, sent my suit off for shipping back to london. We had a 2pm train to catch from Da Nang so we went straight there I think?
- Another overnight train to Saigon/Ho Chi Minh, where I met a nice Scottish couple enjoying their retirement together. I want to be these people when I'm older (reminded me of Tony and Elain from Race Across the World)
- Day in Saigon, we explored the Cu Chi Tunnels (with a guy that would not stop singing) and War Museum (made me cry).
- Day after, I had a morning bus to take, so said fairwell to Harry. My bus took me to Phnom Penh. I was sat next to a nice lady from Scotland who has chosen to structure her life around travel. Gardening in the UK Summer months, and exploring the rest of the year. She was in her 50s. Arriving in Phnom Penh I took a tuk tuk around town, checking into my hotel, then getting some Udon nearby. Currency is officially cambodian, but prices of everything are in dollars and the owners get out an old calculator to convert. I overhear some westerners talking about an impeding stock market crash?

## Precursor: Top Gear

When I was a wee kid in 2009, the UK series of Top Gear aired an episode that would come to sear itself into my memory.

"The Vietnam Special" followed the famous three motoring journalist as they travelled from Saigon to Ha Long Bay on 3 motorbikes over the course of 8 eventful days.
If you haven't watched it, I can't recommend it enough.
Unfortunately, I can't ride a motorbike, but since Top Gear cheated a bit and took the night train, I thought I would follow in their footsteps on my own interpretation of this challenge.

From Ha Long Bay to Saigon in 8 days, skirting the coastline of Vietnam as I make my way down.

## Ha Long Bay

I'm on flight number VN-593 from [Hong Kong]({{< ref "/posts/mini-sabbatical-3-chengdu-to-hongkong" >}}) to Hanoi, arriving at ~4pm.

These kinds of travel days are generally fairly mundane: Train, Plane, Taxi, Hotel, Sleep.
On the face of it I'm in store for much the same routine, except my final destination for the night is over 150km from the hostel.

Luckily I booked this hostel a couple weeks back on [Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com), and had arranged with the hostel owner to take a "limousine" they recommended that was both way cheaper than a taxi, and faster than a bus/train combo.

Well, this "limousine" turns out to be just some dude in an old toyota - can't complain!
The driver can't speak any English, so we communicate via some screen-sharing and laughing, but he isn't following the route on my phone and I'm getting a bit confused...
We stop off and pick up some boxes.
Then stop off again and pick up another box.
Another stop off, we pick up a dog(?)

I'm getting a bit confused here - am I just cargo?
One more stop later and I get my answer, as the man picks up his own daughter and she explains the whole situation to me in good English - a common method of transport in Vietnam are these online groups where you can barter for moving goods or people around.
Their family lives in Ha Long but works in Hanoi so this is quite a frequent trip for them, picking up a dog or confused tourist along the way just helps pay for their trip!

A meandering 4 hour trip later (with dinner break), I arrive at the [Alex Hostel](https://alex.halonghotels.net/en/), grab a Banh Mi from a nearby stall, and conk out on the bed.

I'm only in Ha Long for a day so I thought it would be good to explore the area in the morning.
Not quite sure what I was expecting, but it was clear that a lot of investment had been put into the city, with little to no return.

I was staying in the Bai Chay region of Ha Long, which is the more modern, touristic section of the city cleaved in two by the Bai Chay bridge.
Much of the area in Bai Chay is reclaimed land, upon which has been built a [whole section of European-esque buildings](https://www.nomadicnotes.com/notes-on-ha-long/), complete with statues of prominent European figures.

...That are almost entirely empty...

I sat in a cafe with an iced egg coffee (amazing btw), alone aside from a security guard who was there to protect... nothing.

Strange place, but I can only imagine that the combination of coronavirus and my arrival during the off season were to blame.

Still, I'm here for one reason: To see Ha Long Bay by boat.
