summary: "117 days living, working and travelling in South East Asia"

Between August and November 2023, I paused my normal life in London, and spent some time working and travelling around South East Asia (primarily Singapore).
This blog post is my non-exhaustive attempt at summarising what I experienced, and what I learnt during this time.
Obviously there are some personal/professional things that I don't feel comfortable writing about so publicly, and many things I have already forgotten!
That being said, I feel I have had enough time to digest and reflect on everything that took place.

## Why?

### Rebound from grief

In December 2022, I was quite heavily affected by the passing of my Grandmother, after her long and exhausting battle with Bone Cancer.
Those who knew us knew how close we were, and her passing seriously rocked my emotional foundations, in addition to that of my Mother, Father and Sister.

I try to make sure I take away at least one maxim from each fundamental moment or figure in my life.
From my Nan, these were innumerable, but to pick a few:

- If you think something is wrong, check it **now**
  - This goes without saying, if you suspect you have a health condition, act on it **immediately**.
  It may never just "go away".
- Do what you have to do, then do what you want to do.
  - Something that was barked a lot at me as a kid, primarily about homework.
  I feel it has it's own renewed value in an age of such easy distractions.
- "At least I had a go"
  - I'll never forget this quote, it's the kind of thing I wish we could all say when we look back on our lives.
- Stay independant.
  - My Nan's husband passed away 30 years before she did, but she never let this slow her down and she continued travelling, making memories and friends well into her eighties.
- Be friendly, and keep your friends close.
  - I have never seen a funeral so full of friends, sharing such amazing memories.
  My Nan had this innate ability to form a bond with anyone, no matter how brief the first contact.
  Every Christmas her house would be decorated with a hundred cards, from friends all over the world.
  Almost every day up until she passed, she would be on the phone or having tea with another.
  I even remember being shocked at how she could stay in contact with a couple she had met whilst on a cruise, 20 years prior!

After her passing, I did feel a bit empty.
The impact on me was nothing compared to my parents, and I'm aware my actions have been extremely selfish in contract, just another character flaw I'm working on.

Given this, I needed some time to reflect, and to make some more memories and friends of my own.
So with me, I packed a diary, and I designated 2023 as a year of "learning".

### Depressurising from work

From August 2022 to June 2023, work became insanely busy, with a sequence of "death march" mismanaged development cycles that sucked a lot of the spare energy out of me, as I tech-lead two large streams of work.
We seemed to have this concept of the "hero developer" at the company I worked, who could/would work tirelessly to deliver an almost impossible feat of code-smashing.
Each time we burn out a "hero" we say to ourselves `woah that was crazy, we can't do that again!`, but somehow we always repeat the same mistake.
I'm sure many other companies suffer the same delusions.

This isn't necessarily an entirely bad thing, during these crunch time periods the rate of learning is dramatically increased (partially due to the rate of mistakes also increasing), and you have the ability to grow much stronger professionally, having survived these challenges.

The problems can come when you fail to sufficiently separate work and life, leading to work encroaching on the precious sanctuary of your personal life.
I unfortunately saw this happening to me, so I put my foot down and started planning for a period of time where I deliberately remove myself from this style of work for a bit.

Additionally, I had felt that I was starting to stagnate as an Engineer, and I wanted a new medium to challenge myself with.
Thankfully my manager was very receptive to this, and whilst he took a 3 week break of his own, he allowed me to get a slight flavour of management in his place.

## How?

So, I asked my manager
