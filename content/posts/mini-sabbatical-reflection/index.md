summary: "117 days living, working and travelling in South East Asia"
---

Between August and November 2023, I paused my normal life in London, and spent some time working and travelling around South East Asia (primarily Singapore).
This blog post is my non-exhaustive attempt at summarising what I experienced, and what I learnt during this time.
Obviously there are some personal/professional things that I don't feel comfortable writing about so publicly, and many things I have already forgotten!
That being said, I feel I have had enough time to digest and reflect on everything that took place.

## Why?

Why bother?

### Meeting the girlfriend's family

By September 2023 it would have been ~2 years since I started dating my girlfriend, so I thought it was about time I said hi to her parents!
To complicate matters, her family were still¬†in Beijing, China.

I still wanted to meet them of course, and wanted to make this a priority for 2023 (along with learning a toddler's level of Mandarin, which I unfortunately failed).
So became the goal of "meet the family"!

### Rebound from grief

In December 2022, I was quite heavily affected by the passing of my Grandmother, after her long and exhausting battle with Bone Cancer.
Those who knew us knew how close we were, and her passing seriously rocked my emotional foundations, in addition to that of my Mother, Father and Sister.

I try to make sure I take away at least one maxim from each fundamental moment or figure in my life.
From my Nan, these were innumerable, but to pick a few:

- If you think something is wrong, check it **now**
  - This goes without saying, if you suspect you have a health condition, act on it **immediately**.
  It may never just "go away".
- Do what you have to do, then do what you want to do.
  - Something that was barked a lot at me as a kid, primarily about homework.
  I feel it has it's own renewed value in an age of such easy distractions.
- "At least I had a go"
  - I'll never forget this quote, it's the kind of thing I wish we could all say when we look back on our lives.
- Stay independant.
  - My Nan's husband passed away 30 years before she did, but she never let this slow her down and she continued travelling, making memories and friends well into her eighties.
- Be friendly, and keep your friends close.
  - I have never seen a funeral so full of friends, sharing such amazing memories.
  My Nan had this innate ability to form a bond with anyone, no matter how brief the first contact.
  Every Christmas her house would be decorated with a hundred cards, from friends all over the world.
  Almost every day up until she passed, she would be on the phone or having tea with another.
  I even remember being shocked at how she could stay in contact with a couple she had met whilst on a cruise, 20 years prior!

After her passing, I did feel a bit empty.
The impact on me was nothing compared to my parents, and I'm aware my actions have been extremely selfish in contract, just another character flaw I'm working on.

Given this, I needed some time to reflect, and to make some more memories and friends of my own.
So with me, I packed a diary, and I designated 2023 as a year of "learning".

### Depressurising from work

From August 2022 to June 2023, work became insanely busy, with a sequence of "death march" mismanaged development cycles that sucked a lot of the spare energy out of me, as I tech-lead two large streams of work.
We seemed to have this concept of the "hero developer" at the company I worked, who could/would work tirelessly to deliver an almost impossible feat of code-smashing.
Each time we burn out a "hero" we say to ourselves `woah that was crazy, we can't do that again!`, but somehow we always repeat the same mistake.
I'm sure many other companies suffer the same delusions.

This isn't necessarily an entirely bad thing, during these crunch time periods the rate of learning is dramatically increased (partially due to the rate of mistakes also increasing), and you have the ability to grow much stronger professionally, having survived these challenges.

The problems can come when you fail to sufficiently separate work and life, leading to work encroaching on the precious sanctuary of your personal life.
I unfortunately saw this happening to me, so I put my foot down and started planning for a period of time where I deliberately remove myself from this style of work for a bit.

Additionally, I had felt that I was starting to stagnate as an Engineer, and I wanted a new medium to challenge myself with.
Thankfully my manager was very receptive to this, and whilst he took a 3 week break of his own, he allowed me to get a slight flavour of management in his place.
// TODO: Link to reflection on management.

## How?

In late 2022 / early 2023 (I can't remember) I approached my manager requesting a 3 month sabbatical.
Turns out this wasn't quite as easy as I had hoped, and came with a fairly significant opportunity cost, so we "pivoted".
There was an opportunity within the company to take part in a secondment to Singapore to assist with the production support team, handling live client incidents within the APAC region.

This sounded somewhat daunting, but combined with a revised 6 week sabbatical (of which only 3 were unpaid), it came with a few key advantages over the original plan:

- Much lower opportunity cost (3 weeks unpaid vs 3 months)
- The company paid for the big flight tickets to/from Singapore (thanks!)
- Put up in a nice hotel for 3 months, get to hang out with some really cool people from Singapore and take part in all the "crazy Singapore office" stories I had heard so much about.
- My GF could only take 3 weeks holiday from work anyway, so this reduced the time I was travelling along

So, we agreed on the duration, and queued up my secondment, so the dates were set!
31st July -> 27th November.

## Pre-departure

### Visas and Vaccinations

For a long time, I didn't really know where I would end up going, so with the knowledge of "China at some point" I made a "Grand Asian Itinerary" and started listing places I wanted to visit.
Once the dates were settled, I split this into 3 weeks of China, and 3 weeks of everywhere else, with the intention that China would be the first 3 weeks due to other scheduling constraints.
For China we knew we wanted to spend around a week in Beijing, and travel to some other key places (Great Wall, Terracotta Army, Shanghai, Sichuan province for the food), so for the most part we just placed these on the map and connected the dots with what we could reasonably travel to by train.

For the remaining 3 weeks, I wanted to try to mimick [Race Across the World](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002tvs) as much as possible, so despite it being shockingly cheap, I tried to avoid planes as much as possible whilst around South East Asia.
Once we had decided on Hong Kong being the last destination from the China portion, and knowing I had a return flight from Singapore to catch, it once again became a connect-the-dots exercise.

#### Chinese Visa

Thanks to the UK passport, I only needed a tourist visa from China.
Unfortunately, the plan was a bit in flux still, and I had some slight challenges since I was applying for the Visa more than 3 months in advance of my visit to China (not strictly allowed according to the rules).

The whole Visa process itself was quite daunting, and this was not helped by the fact that their online application system was in a half-half state of readiness.
Since covid started, China had stopped issuing tourist visas, and only restarted applications in ~April 2023.
I was applying in May/June so they were still ramping up and changing rules as I went through the application, which was fun.

The [application website](https://bio.visaforchina.cn/LON3_EN/qianzhengyewu) had a slightly different set of rules to the [Chinese embassy site](http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/visa/qzxz/) and I even contacted both the Singaporean embassy and the London embassy to see where would be best to apply from.

In the end, as with most bureacratic issues, once you talk to a reasonable person, the issue becomes a non-issue, and they were mostly ok with me applying a few months in advance.
They even granted me a 2 year Visa instead of my requested 3 month one!

The only hiccup I had while applying, was that during my visa appointment, sat in front of the application interviewer, they asked to see my flight tickets, which I hadn't booked! The Visa rules had changed in between me booking the appointment, and it actually taking place, so I needed to hurriedly book return flights from London to Beijing (not cheap!) whilst sat in front of the interviewer.
Let me just say, that was one of the most stressful and expensive mornings of my life!

Not least because the first set of tickets I hurriedly bought, were non-refundable, and I had spelt my own name wrong on the tickets! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Vaccinations

For the most part, I just took everything recommended from the [Fit for Travel NHS website](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations#asia-east), under "East Asia".

This required a few visits to the doctors/pharmacy to consult about vaccinations (ultimately deciding a couple were not worth the cost), and then ultimately have them administered over a few sessions.

Hilariously, the first vaccination session I had 5 vaccinations in one go, and ended up passing out (I'm not good with needles!), so that certainly felt like the weirdest ~¬£300 I ever spent.

Overall, vaccinations were the easiest part of this to organise.
