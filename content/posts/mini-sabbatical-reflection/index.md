summary: "117 days living, working and travelling in South East Asia"

Between August and November 2023, I paused my normal life in London, and spent some time working and travelling around South East Asia (primarily Singapore).
This blog post is my non-exhaustive attempt at summarising what I experienced, and what I learnt during this time.
Obviously there are some personal/professional things that I don't feel comfortable writing about, and many things I have already forgotten!
That being said, I feel I have had enough time to digest and reflect on everything that took place.

## Why?
