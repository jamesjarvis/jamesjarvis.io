I think travel blog with personal takes, but with factual information. Cut out irrelevant information.


- Day after, I had a morning bus to take, so said fairwell to Harry. My bus took me to Phnom Penh. I was sat next to a nice lady from Scotland who has chosen to structure her life around travel. Gardening in the UK Summer months, and exploring the rest of the year. She was in her 50s. Arriving in Phnom Penh I took a tuk tuk around town, checking into my hotel, then getting some Udon nearby. Currency is officially cambodian, but prices of everything are in dollars and the owners get out an old calculator to convert. I overhear some westerners talking about an impeding stock market crash?
- Bus to Siem Reap, on arrival I went for a walk to explore the local area, where apparently the thing to do is to have fish clean your feet.
- Whole day in Siem Reap, I hired a bike and cycled around the temples for 8 hours, my favourite part of the trip. Evening I visited the best cambodian food place yet.
- Flight to Bangkok, I didn't want to go here just from the stories I had heard. Arrived late so went straight to sleep.
- In the morning, talked with some of the other hostel goers before visiting a floating village/market. In the evening we met back up again to watch muay thai.
- Another time, I walked around all of Bangkok, eventually visiting the Golden Temple. Sat for some food in an empty restaurant, overlooking the temple from a terrace. A couple in their 40s later sat down and started speaking with me. They had each independantly visited bangkok in their 20s many years ago and were recreating their trips together this time. As I left I discovered they had paid for my food.
- Left for Koh Samui, where I did basically nothing for 5 days straight.
- Back to Singapore for 1 night staying in Arab St. Met up with some coworkers as they started their own rotation in Singapore. We shared some stories. Saw another coworker who I thought was dead, has 9 lives it seems.
- Last day was "black friday", I spent the whole day shopping for gifts for my family before flying back and meeting up with them for the first time in 117 days.
