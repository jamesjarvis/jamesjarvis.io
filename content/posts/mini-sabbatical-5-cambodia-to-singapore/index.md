I think travel blog with personal takes, but with factual information. Cut out irrelevant information.


- Day after, I had a morning bus to take, so said fairwell to Harry. My bus took me to Phnom Penh. I was sat next to a nice lady from Scotland who has chosen to structure her life around travel. Gardening in the UK Summer months, and exploring the rest of the year. She was in her 50s. Arriving in Phnom Penh I took a tuk tuk around town, checking into my hotel, then getting some Udon nearby. Currency is officially cambodian, but prices of everything are in dollars and the owners get out an old calculator to convert. I overhear some westerners talking about an impeding stock market crash?
- Bus to Siem Reap, on arrival I went for a walk to explore the local area, where apparently the thing to do is to have fish clean your feet.
- Whole day in Siem Reap, I hired a bike and cycled around the temples for 8 hours, my favourite part of the trip. Evening I visited the best cambodian food place yet.
- Flight to Bangkok, I didn't want to go here just from the stories I had heard. Arrived late so went straight to sleep.
- In the morning, talked with some of the other hostel goers before visiting a floating village/market. In the evening we met back up again to watch muay thai.
- Another time, I walked around all of Bangkok, eventually visiting the Golden Temple. Sat for some food in an empty restaurant, overlooking the temple from a terrace. A couple in their 40s later sat down and started speaking with me. They had each independantly visited bangkok in their 20s many years ago and were recreating their trips together this time. As I left I discovered they had paid for my food.
- Left for Koh Samui, where I did basically nothing for 5 days straight.
- Back to Singapore for 1 night staying in Arab St. Met up with some coworkers as they started their own rotation in Singapore. We shared some stories. Saw another coworker who I thought was dead, has 9 lives it seems.
- Last day was "black friday", I spent the whole day shopping for gifts for my family before flying back and meeting up with them for the first time in 117 days.

## Bus across the Cambodian border

Picking up [where we left off in Saigon]({{< ref "/posts/mini-sabbatical-4-vietnam" >}}), are you still with me?
I'm on a Giant Ibis bus bound for Phnom Penh in Cambodia, a gentle ~7 hour trip across the border and through basically nothing else of note.

My seat-neighbour for this trip is a nice lady from Scotland who has chosen to structure her life around travel.
Gardening in the UK summer months and exploring for the rest of the year, she's in her mid fifties and sounds like she has no intention of slowing down!

What surprised me is just how much less developed Cambodia felt than Vietnam, with dirt roads being the norm, and the border itself being a strange mix of undeveloped wasteland, and golden casinos.
Once you start to near the capital, Phnom Penh, you can see where the money has gone.

Out of absolutely nowhere springs palatial buildings, and seemingly unnecessary skyscrapers.

## Phnom Penh

The city has an inauthentic feel to it, it really doesn't fit in with the rest of the country.
The wealth divide is crystal clear as Rolls Royces mix in the traffic with Tuk Tuks.
The currency is apparently a locals joke, as I attempt to pay for my dinner with my hard found Riels, and the cashier sighs, pulls out a calculator and types `8 * 4015` to give me a rough amount for Cambodian Riels.

Apparently Dollars are the [currency of choice](https://movetocambodia.com/about-cambodia/currency/) for many here.

To get around, you'll be using Grab again, but Grab Bikes are out, with Grab Tuk Tuks taking their place.

The night market looked like the place to be, but I was staying a bit further out in the "westerners section" and just wanted to relax at the hostel for a bit.

On a walk around town in the evening, I overheard some American ex-pats catching up and talking about an impending stock market crash.
Hilariously, a few weeks prior while I was in China my coworkers texted me to say my company had just announced a large round of layoffs.
I texted back with "cant be bothered to check my email, can someone just text me if Iâ€™ve been fired k thx x", no economic shocks are going to ruin these vibes.

The town is surrounded by armed guards and has a chronic lack of pedestrian walking signals.
Not knowing the jaywalking rules in this country, it takes me forever to get back to the hostel.

### Tuol Sleng / S-21

I'm only in Phnom Penh for 24 hours, so before my next bus at midday, I'm in a Tuk Tuk to visit [Security Prison 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum).

This place is a solid contender for Most Shocking Museum I've Visited, right alongside the Vietnam War Remnants Museum.

I had just about had time to research about the Khmer Rouge on the bus through Cambodia, and it shocked me.
If you don't know, the Khmer Rouge (Communist Party of Kampuchea) came to power in the late 1970's at the same time that communism was making it's way through South East Asia.

I still know little about this period of history, but aside from Americas intervention in Vietnam, communism made huge waves throughout Asia, with the only notable survivor from this being the "communist" PRC, who had a similarly devastating cultural revolution before deciding that a good old fashioned capitalist dictatorship works best for them.

The Khmer Rouge however defied all logic and entered into a campaign of totalitarian repression, and ultimately, genocide.
To put it simply, the Khmer Rouge destroyed almost all of the country's infrastructure (schools, roads, railways), and killed roughly _25% of the total Cambodian population_, specifically minority groups and those with enough intelligence to pose a threat to politicians.

All told, this set the country back from its peers by decades, with the country still struggling to rebuild to this day.

Focusing on Tuol Sleng, the former school became a prison/centre for torture, from which only 0.03% of prisoners ever left alive.

Much of it has been left untouched, with beds placed in the same position as they were found, minus any human remains.

Photos of inmates, stories of couples who had been split up and separately executed for no reason, this would shock anyone to the core.

On the way out, there were some elderly people sitting behind a booth.
The signs said they had been former prisoners (or guards, I can't recall), and that they were there to spread the story of their survival to future generations.
They may even be [Chum Mey or Bou Meng from this BBC article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33096971), but I couldn't talk to them, I didn't know what to say.

I left, slightly disturbed, but peaceful in the knowledge that at least information about this horrific regime is being spread.
History is most likely to repeat itself, when people do not know it happened before.

## Siem Reap

Another bus, another city, I'm getting the hang of this.

I arrive in Siem Reap, dump my bags at the hostel, book a couple activities for the next few days and go for a walk around town to understand what this place has to offer.

Thanks to the lack of good transport in Cambodia, your only real option is to get Buses around, with the downside that by the time you reach anywhere, the chances are that it is now too dark to enjoy.

But Siem Reap, a town where over 50% of the locals are employed in the tourism industry, has enough to offer the weary traveller.
Each South East Asian tourist town has the same staples: Markets, Pubs, Restaurants, with typically the same stuff.
However they also each reserve a slight speciality.

For Siem Reap this appeared to be Fish Tanks to eat the dead skin off of your feet.
I did not partake.

### Temples

The next day, I had hired a bike to explore the nearby temples.
