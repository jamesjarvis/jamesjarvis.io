## Professional

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net), where for the last 4.5 years I have been helping build the world's best cloud-native Core Banking engine to power the next generation of banks.

## Unprofessional

I have recently moved to the suburbs of London, where I am renovating a 1950's era house with my girlfriend and family.

It's been a huge undertaking and I hope to share some of my experience through this blog.

If you haven't seen, I have been recording a second of my life every day since I turned 18.
You can see my experience here: [One Second Every Day]({{<ref "tags/one-second-everyday/">}})
