## Professional

I am currently a Product Engineer at [incident.io](https://incident.io/), helping build the tool that helps engineers fix production faster.

## Unprofessional

I have recently moved to the suburbs of London, where I am renovating a 1950's era house with my girlfriend and family.
I'm almost finished now, only a couple rooms left!
If you have any plumber/bathroom fitter recommendations, please email me!

It's been a huge undertaking and I hope to share some of my experience through this blog.

If you haven't seen, I have been recording a second of my life every day since I turned 18.
You can see my experience here: [One Second Every Day]({{<ref "tags/one-second-everyday/">}})
