Since the 23rd June 2016, my 18th birthday, I have been recording one second of every day of my life.

This all started out after watching Cesar Kuriyama's [(link)](http://www.cesarkuriyama.com) fantastic TED talk [(link)](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day) on his project of the same name and nature.

I wouldn't be lying if I said this has been one of my favourite projects I have ever embarked on in my life. As my care for social media has dwindled, this project has remained. I started this project with the goal of making myself accountable to do at least one worthwhile thing every day, and it has flourished into a way to reflect on my growth as a person.

This could mean anything, it could be that I visited a place/did something for the first time, or treated someone special to me, or just took time to enjoy the little moments of life.

You can watch [my whole adult life back to back](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkusHjaZhA7nFyNLqDfw2zXeXfs3KfxgE), or if you'd rather watch something a little bit cooler, you can check out some of my other videos on youtube where I have recorded some more ambitious moments. Or alternatively, one of my [favourite videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg) of all time.
