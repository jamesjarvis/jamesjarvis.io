title: "The 'Mini Sabbatical'"

Between August and November 2023, I paused my normal life in London, and spent some time working and travelling around South East Asia (primarily Singapore).

This series of blog posts is my non-exhaustive attempt at summarising what I experienced, and what I learnt during this time.

Obviously there are some personal/professional things that I don't feel comfortable writing about so publicly, and many things I have already forgotten!

That being said, I feel I have had enough time to digest and reflect on everything that took place.
