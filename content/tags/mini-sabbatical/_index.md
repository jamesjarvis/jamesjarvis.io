title: "The 'Mini Sabbatical'"

Between August and November 2023, I paused my normal life in London, and spent some time working and travelling around South East Asia (primarily Singapore).

This series of blog posts is my attempt at summarising what I experienced, and what I learnt during this time.

As a reader, you may not be the right audience for these posts!
These are intended as a way for me to remember these experiences, and share them with those I care about, they are not easily consumable if you don't care about me, and that's ok.

I also live-blogged about this trip on my [Polarsteps "Grand Asian Adventure"](https://www.polarsteps.com/JamesJarvis/9085777-grand-asian-adventure), so you can follow along there as well.

I hope you get some enjoyment out of reading this, as I did both experiencing and writing.
