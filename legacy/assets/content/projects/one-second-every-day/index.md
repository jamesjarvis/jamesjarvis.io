Since the 23rd June 2016, my 18th birthday, I have been recording one second of every day of my life.

This all started out after watching Cesar Kuriyama's [(link)](http://www.cesarkuriyama.com) fantastic TED talk [(link)](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day) on his project of the same name and nature.

I wouldn't be lying if I said this has been one of my favourite projects I have ever embarked on in my life. As my care for social media has dwindled, this project has remained. I started this project with the goal of making myself accountable to do at least one worthwhile thing every day, and it has flourished into a way to reflect on my growth as a person.

This could mean anything, it could be that I visited a place/did something for the first time, or treated someone special to me, or just took time to enjoy the little moments of life.

You can watch [my whole adult life back to back](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkusHjaZhA7nFyNLqDfw2zXeXfs3KfxgE), or if you'd rather watch something a little bit cooler, you can check out some of my other videos on youtube where I have recorded some more ambitious moments. Or alternatively, one of my [favourite videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg) of all time.

## 24 Years Old

From 23rd June 2022 to 23rd June 2023.

This year has been an unfortunate reset.

Coming back from ‚Äúthe Italian trip‚Äù, I am forced to scrap my beloved but troublesome Z4. However I continue to enjoy a wonderful summer, I take Feiyang camping, we try surfing, I go to Wimbledon, Northern Ireland, several weddings, long walks and a bit of kayaking.

November was the hardest month to date. I‚Äôm crashed into on the way to a holiday with Feiyang, totalling my car. I lose my best friend, Nan. Things are put back into perspective. We have a quieter Christmas.

I set goals for 2023, to learn, and to travel. I make an attempt to pick up Mandarin, I set a new personal reading record, and put into motion plans to spend some time out of work. I move out of my flat and wish Konrad all the best at Google. My cousin and her wife got married in Scotland!

Around this point, my Grandad‚Äôs Dementia has worsened to the point where we move him into a care home and my parents tackle selling both his and my Nans houses. Our adoring but ailing dog, Dusta, has to be put down.

However, the year ends on a high with summer back in full swing! Dad retires just in time for us to spend mine and my sister‚Äôs birthday on a boat in the Norfolk Broads!

My Mum has been our rock. Feiyang has been there for everything. I wish my parents the best start to their happy retirement. Stay tuned!

## 23 Years Old

From 23rd June 2021 to 23rd June 2022.

As the world slowly started to shake off the pandemic I decided to move to London with Konrad. Then I immediately got COVID *facepalm*.

Living in my favourite city in the world for a whole year has been a lot of fun (and v expensive), making some new friends and getting used to a bit more of a settled down lifestyle, although it is a bit scary!

I've continued with my hobby of making and breaking lots of software, sailed on the Thames, hiked Snowdonia, and met Feiyang!

My love-hate relationship with the BMW has continued, from having to almost scrap it in November to driving it 3000 miles around Europe in June; I finally drove to the Italian lakes!

## 22 Years Old

From 23rd June 2020 to 23rd June 2021.

First year in full time work (at a smol company called ThoughtMachine) and first year I missed a few days filming!

With most of my life + lifestyle banned under pandemic restrictions it‚Äôs been a bit quieter than I would have liked, and there‚Äôs been some tough times, but things will change!

Kicked off this year climbing a mountain, exploring Cornwall, spending a lot of time sat behind a computer, had a wonderful Christmas with the family, walked dozens of kilometres hanging out with my dad, and then walked 42k in one day with Sam!

I built a dashboard, link scraper and a few other things, shaved my head, impulse bought an old bmw as a semi fixer-upper, travelled to Scotland the day after lockdowns started to lift and ended the year starting to see people again!

## 21 Years Old

From 23rd June 2019 to 23rd June 2020.

Waved goodbye to Cali, met the fam in Florida. Quick catch ups with the friends and family I haven‚Äôt seen for a year then straight into the final part of my degree.
Joined Kayaking this time, got to know some lovely people and even travel to Wales with them! Kept working part time with my Cisco team throughout uni, and tinkering in my free time. Took mum to Morocco, met some friends in Barcelona, and had a weekend in Amsterdam with Maj and Sam just a few days before the Coronavirus lockdown!

Lockdown meant I had to slow down a bit, enjoy time with the family and celebrate mine and my sister's birthday at home for the first time in 4 years.

## 20 Years Old

From 23rd June 2018 to 23rd June 2019.

I moved to California for a year to pursue my dreams of Silicon Valley. Travelled by car more than I have ever before, became a much better developer, became somewhat American and much more independant.

Made some incredible memories and international friends this year, but the pace isn't slowing down any time soon!

## 19 Years Old

From 23rd June 2017 to 23rd June 2018.

My second year of university, I was on the committee of both sailing and travel societies, I got some exciting job offers, ended a relationship and I said some sad goodbyes before my year in California!

Had an amazing year, and I‚Äôve loved documenting it like this. I can‚Äôt wait to find out what the next year (and this 3rd decade of life) has for me!

## 18 Years Old

From 23rd June 2016 to 23rd June 2017.

I didn't manage to film every day, but I'm so glad I started this, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.
