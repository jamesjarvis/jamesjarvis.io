This very site you are reading, is open source.
You may fork it and fill in your own data if you wish, and all of the source code is on GitHub.
I created this with GatsbyJS as I knew the benefits of being able to have a site which simply consumes data stored externally, rather than hard coding everything, which I felt was the issue with many other portfolio sites.
