Since the 23rd June 2016, my 18th birthday, I have been recording one second of every day of my life.

This all started out after watching [Cesar Kuriyama's](http://www.cesarkuriyama.com) [fantastic TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day) on his project of the same name and nature.

I wouldn't be lying if I said this has been one of my favourite projects I have ever embarked on in my life. As my care for social media has dwindled, this project has remained. I started this project with the goal of making myself accountable to do at least one worthwhile thing every day, and it has flourished into a way to reflect on my growth as a person.

This could mean anything, it could be that I visited a place/did something for the first time, or treated someone special to me, or just took time to enjoy the little moments of life.

You can watch my whole adult life back to back [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkusHjaZhA7nFyNLqDfw2zXeXfs3KfxgE), or if you'd rather watch something a little bit cooler, you can check out some of my other videos on youtube where I have recorded some more ambitious moments. Or alternatively, one of my [favourite videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg) of all time.

From 23rd June 2017 to 23rd June 2018.

My second year of university, I was on the committee of both sailing and travel societies, I got some exciting job offers, ended a relationship and I said some sad goodbyes before my year in California!

Had an amazing year, and Iâ€™ve loved documenting it like this. I canâ€™t wait to find out what the next year (and this 3rd decade of life) has for me!

From 23rd June 2016 to 23rd June 2017.

I didn't manage to film every day, but I'm so glad I started this, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.
