![Confirmed COVID-19 cases prediction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesjarvis/corona-infection-prediction-uk/master/plots/logistical/confirmedcases/logistic-plot.png)

This project was a slightly morbid experiment with data plotting and predictions.

The idea was to have a set of graphs that can automatically update as new data is published, since the coronavirus pandemic is such a rapidly changing event.

I am not en expert, I'm just curious with how well the data can predict the future.
