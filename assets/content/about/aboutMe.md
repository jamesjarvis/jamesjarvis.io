Hi, I'm James.
I'm currently on industrial placement at Cisco Systems in between my studies at the University of Kent.
I am passionate about photography/videography, I love to build things and I am always searching for cheap plane tickets somewhere.
Feel free to reach out to me below regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
