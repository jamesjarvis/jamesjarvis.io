Hi, I'm James.
I'm currently on industrial placement in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley) at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com) in between my studies at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk), and between my day to day work I actively contribute to my ongoing projects. My (probably slightly out of date) [CV is here](cv/resume.pdf).
In my spare time you'll probably find me hopping on a cheap plane somewhere, camera in my hand and in search for an adventure.
Feel free to reach out to me below regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
Also, if you're into that sort of stuff, you can find my public keys [here](https://keybase.pub/jamesjarvis/keys/).
