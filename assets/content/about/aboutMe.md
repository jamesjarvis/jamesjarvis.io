Hi, I'm James.
I'm passionate about learning, building 'cool' stuff and travelling.
If you want a quick catch up on who I am, skip straight to [my One Second Everyday](../projects/one-second-every-day/).
At the moment, I can generally be found in and around [London, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), or online by clicking on any of the links below.
In my spare time you'll probably find me hopping on a cheap plane somewhere, camera in my hand and in search for an adventure, (or more accurately in lockdown, building something with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - I think I'm addicted to them).
Feel free to reach out to me below regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
Also, if you're into that sort of stuff, you can find my public keys [here](https://keybase.pub/jamesjarvis/keys/).
