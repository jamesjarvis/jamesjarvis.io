Hi, I'm James.
I'm passionate about learning, building 'cool' stuff and travelling.
This year, 2020, I will be completing my [degree](https://www.kent.ac.uk) and getting back to work, who knows where I will be in 10 years?
At the moment, I can generally be found in [Canterbury, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury), or online by clicking on any of the links below.
In my spare time you'll probably find me hopping on a cheap plane somewhere, camera in my hand and in search for an adventure.
Feel free to reach out to me below regarding professional work, or just for a chat!
My (probably slightly out of date) [CV is here](cv/resume.pdf).
Also, if you're into that sort of stuff, you can find my public keys [here](https://keybase.pub/jamesjarvis/keys/).
